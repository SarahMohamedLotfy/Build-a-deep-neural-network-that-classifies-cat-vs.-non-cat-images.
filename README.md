Build-a-deep-neural-network-that-classifies-cat-vs.-non-cat-images.

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
